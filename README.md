<h3 align="center">Telecommunication Engineering Student | Fullstack Web Development and UI/UX Design Enthusiast</h3>

While I am not pursuing a degree in Computer Science or Art, I am experienced in Frontend Web Development and UI/UX and have worked on several projects in these two fields. I love creating websites with React, but doing backend stuff with MERN Stack is an option too. I am also comfortable with using Adobe Photoshop and Figma to create professional UI/UX Designs.
